Clone the repo and go to the folder: avest-client and run *npm install* or *yarn install* then run npm start or *yarn start*, a tab will be open in the browser (localhost:3000)

Open the repo in your IDE and click *clean and build* and then click *Run* (this is for NetBeans IDE) a tab in the browser will be open (http://localhost:8080/AvesProject/) then add in the url this: resources/birds so the full URL will be http://localhost:8080/AvesProject/resources/birds and you'll see a JsonArray as a result if you see this then the server was set correctly.
